I'm following alongside the class online over the summer break. I'm an alumni trying to switch fields into computational linguistics so I'm trying to improve my computer skills.  I enjoy the videos.  However, they seem to drop in quality as the term progresses.  It may be more ideal to create a single online amalgation of all past lectures and videos.
